     <h1><em>My hobbies</em></h1>
     <p><strong>Hobbies are what keeps me busy and engaged all the time.</strong> <br>Some of my hobbies are as follows: </p>
       <ul class="article">
         <li><h3>Sketching</h3>
          It's amazing a pencil can bring pictures to life.</li>
         <li><h3>Crocheting</h3>
          Crocheting brings nostalgic feeling about how I would rush home on the last day of my school for Summer break<br>
          Feeling really excited to start Crocheting my new project that I had been planning for my summer break.</li>
         <li><h3>Photography</h3>
           My photography interest sparked when I receive a dslr Camera from my Teacher. <br>
          Photography has changed my prospective of veiwing the world in a different way.</li>
